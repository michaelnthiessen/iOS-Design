# iOS-Design

Awhile ago (before iOS 7) I designed an app that was to be used for people with speaking disabilities. The idea is that you pre-program messages that are based on actions and objects, and then the user can navigate using the large buttons. Sort of a simplified Stephen-Hawking device.

Here are screenshots of my design.
